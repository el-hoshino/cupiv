# cupiv
This is a CUDA accelerated PIV program which I made in university.

The program code is actually very old that is only guaranteed to be compatible with CUDA SDK 3.0 (I'm not sure if it's cimpatible with current CUDA SDK).

In addition, I didn't have time to finish the argc/argv part so you're required to modify the filenames in the source code and compile it, but since this is an open-source project under ECL you're welcome to fork it and custimize it.

Maybe in the future when I have time I'll maintain this project again but currently I don't have that much time.
